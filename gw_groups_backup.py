Script: exportGoogleGroupsToDrive - Export Google Groups and Members to Google Drive

Description:
This Python script automates the process of exporting all Google Groups and their members within a Google Workspace domain to a CSV file. The CSV file is then uploaded to a specified folder within a shared Google Drive. The script includes error handling for common issues such as Google API service unavailability (503 errors) and SSL/TLS connection errors. The script is designed to run in a GitHub Actions environment, using secrets stored in GitHub for secure access to sensitive information.

Functions:
- `get_google_groups()`: Retrieves all Google Groups in the Google Workspace domain.
- `check_folder_exists(drive_service, folder_id)`: Verifies the existence of the specified Google Drive folder and checks if it is accessible.
- `get_group_members(service, group_email, retries=3, delay=5)`: Retrieves the members of a specific Google Group, with a retry mechanism for handling 503 errors.
- `upload_file_to_drive(drive_service, csv_file, filename, folder_id, retries=3, delay=5)`: Uploads the CSV file to the specified Google Drive folder, with a retry mechanism for handling SSL and HTTP errors.
- `export_groups_to_csv(groups, folder_id)`: The main function that:
  1. Generates a timestamped CSV file containing the group and member data.
  2. Saves the CSV file to a specified Google Drive folder.

Usage:
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - The script relies on three environment variables, which should be provided via GitHub Secrets:
     - `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`: Contains the service account credentials in JSON format.
     - `FOLDER_ID`: The ID of the Google Drive folder where the CSV file will be uploaded.
     - `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL`: The super admin email address used for domain-wide delegation.
   - The `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` is parsed in-memory — no credentials file is written to disk.

2. **Google Groups Retrieval**:
   - The script retrieves all Google Groups in the domain using the Google Admin SDK Directory API.
   - It then iterates over each group to retrieve its members.
   - If a group member retrieval fails due to a 503 error, the script retries the operation up to three times before skipping the group.

3. **Google Drive Folder**:
   - The script uploads the generated CSV file to a specific Google Drive folder, identified by its folder ID.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The script includes robust error handling to manage issues such as service unavailability (503 errors) and SSL connection problems.
   - If a file upload fails due to an SSL or HTTP error, the script retries the upload operation up to three times before failing.

Notes:
- **Permissions:** The script requires domain-wide delegation to access the Google Admin SDK Directory API and Google Drive API. Ensure that the necessary OAuth scopes are authorized for the service account.
- **GitHub Actions Integration:** This script is designed to be run within a GitHub Actions workflow, with secrets for sensitive information stored securely in GitHub.
- **Customization:** You can customize the retry mechanisms and delays for handling specific errors to suit your environment.
